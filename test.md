Controversies follow those who dare to deter from the traditional path to explore the unknown.

[Dr. Frank Lipman](https://www.drfranklipman.com/), a professional internal medicine doctor, followed the path of functional medicine to solve the mystery of longevity.

Functional medicine is not everyone's cup of tea, but you can't ignore his 35 years of experience where he considered longevity an important aspect of his work.

Lifestyle medicine can boost your longevity, but these everyday mistakes are wrecking your chance at a long and healthy life.

So, follow Dr. Lipman's advice and give up these reckless daily habits to improve your health span for a better quality of life.
### The biggest adversary of longevity

Inflammation is the biggest roadblock in your journey to healthy longevity. And overeating is the kerosene that accelerates inflammation rapidly.

"We all eat too much", a problem that Dr. Lipman addresses [within the first 30 seconds of this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keLwUmbNcVg)

Calorie restriction is proven to boost longevity. [Eating fewer calories daily supports the aging process](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03277-6#:~:text=Cutting%20calorie%20intake%20can%20lead,caused%20by%20consuming%20less%20food.), a truth we have known for at least a decade.

The scarcity mindset forces you to fill your, so you fall for the family-size packs that guarantee the best deals at the cost of your health.

The fat in your tissues overflows and leaks into muscles and organs over time. It's a catastrophic situation that causes metabolic diseases like diabetes.

[Obesity is linked to poor brain health as it can decrease the grey matter](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8302366/) and can even change the structure of the brain over time.

Another diet mistake that increases inflammation is sugar, an ingredient hidden in most healthy foods.

Increased sugar consumption damages your gut health as it wrecks the diversity of the gut microbiome, which can cause a leaky gut.

[A diverse microbiome can help suppress the types of T cells](http://A healthy gut is your first defense against inflammation.) which cause inflammation. A healthy gut is your first defense against inflammation.

Your diet is the deciding factor when it comes to health. A simple change in diet alone makes a significant difference in your health and longevity.

Moreover, the right diet today will keep your brain healthy in the long run. Protect it from teh dangers of inflammation by eating the optimal amount.
### The one thing your brain needs the most

The productivity bandwagon made us believe that life is useless unless you burn the midnight oil every night to become rich overnight.

This consumeristic mindset convinces you to work for all the things you need. Society is a harsh judge, so you work hard.

But in the quest to achieve appreciation from society, you lose your health a little every day.

Sleep is mistaken as a passive process when it's an essential function without which your body can't survive.

Your brain is hard at work when you sleep, the glymphatic system is a fluid clearance pathway that eliminates metabolic waste products from the brain.

[A disruption in the glymphatic process](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9656009/) can cause headaches and increase your risk of Parkinson's disease as well.

Sleep deprivation can harm your cognitive functions as it can disturb [memory consolidation in the hippocampus.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10155483/)

Yet we don't value the importance of a good night's sleep so you don't practice proper sleep hygiene that can boost your sleep quality.

[Sleeping patterns boost longevity as 8%](https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2023/02/22/21/35/Getting-Good-Sleep-Could-Add-Years-to-Your-Life) of deaths from any cause are linked to poor sleep patterns.

Getting enough sleep is no longer enough. Low sleep latency, restful sleep quality, and the ability to stay asleep contribute to good sleep quality.

And the only way to achieve optimal sleep quality is by following an easy sleep schedule that you can follow consistently daily.

Dr. Lipman prescribes a simple habit that leads to a better sleep schedule is having the same wake-up and bedtime.

Be flexible if socialization pushes your bedtime on weekends or on holidays but make sure to follow your wake-up time daily no matter what.

You can take short naps during the day to catch up on your sleep, but wake up at the same time to maintain a consistent sleep schedule.

Get sunlight first thing in the morning to regulate the circadian rhythm and try not to settle the sleep debt on the weekends.
### It only takes 15 minutes daily to save your longevity

Lifestyle is formed by daily habits that you do without a single thought. These routines are so familiar that you don't have to think twice before performing them.

One habit that can improve your lifestyle instantly is exercise, but it's not easy so it takes years of practice to achieve automaticity.

Movement on the other hand can be added to a routine easily. So, equate movement with an active lifestyle before you get intimidated by exercise.

You cut short your longevity by falling prey to a sedentary lifestyle which can be easily contested with regular movement throughout the day.

[Regular physical activity has been found to decrease all-cause mortality by 30% to 35%,](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3395188/) it's a staggering stat that should get you out and moving.

Exercise snacks during the day can reduce your risk of premature death caused by sedentary behavior.

But sadly it's not enough to protect your brain from the clutches of aging. You also need exercise in your daily routine to fight the effects of aging.

[Strength training has been found to boost BDNF,](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9658702/) an essential protein that regulates neural function and regulation.

It can even [reduce the risk of Alzheimer's by 50%](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8126521/) in people who are predisposed to the APOE 3/4 gene.

Moreover, muscle is a metabolic organ that regulates energy in the body but it becomes slow and weak with age, so you need to train it consistently.

So, exercise is the one resolution you direly need these new years but the real task is to follow through with consistency.

Make movement your goal till exercise becomes second nature for you. It will take you a few years to fall in love with exercise, but it's worth it.
### Protect your brain from the deadliest toxin

Easy habits are often forgotten because of their simplistic nature, a mistake that can cost you your health in the long run.

One such mistake is dehydration, which causes a plethora of problems that can be solved by sipping water timely.

Your brain is 73% water, so even mild dehydration(1%–2%) can caus[e poor cognitive performance and affect your short-term memory.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4207053/#:~:text=Recently%20we%20have%20learned%20that,in%20need%20of%20additional%20research.)
It contributes to poor concentration and slows down critical thinking.

Moreover, dehydration decreases the levels of water in the bloodstream which can make your blood sugar levels shoot up.

A sugar spike impacts cognition and causes brain fog that leads to low concentration and poor focus.

All this can be easily mended by picking up a glass of water, a simple and essential habit that we fail at miserably.

Another habit that leaves you dehydrated is alcohol. It's a diuretic that not only makes you dehydrated but also impacts brain function in the long run.

So, not only are you skipping on the one drink that can ensure proper hydration but also indulging in the most harmful substance that causes dehydration.

There's no habit easier than sipping water regularly, it can help you boost longevity and improve brain health at the same time.

And reduce your alcohol consumption to a minimum to save your brain from this addiction, it's a toxin that's been promoted for centuries to facilitate socialization.
### The modern plague that kills your brain health

Loneliness is the silent pandemic that kills your longevity and brain health a little every day.

The staggering stats point to the rapid increase in worldwide loneliness that causes people to take extreme measures daily.

The pandemic has highlighted the depressive state of society, [where one in four people feels lonely worldwide.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/well/mind/loneliness-brain-dementia-isolation.html)

Loneliness activates a stress response that pushes you to look for a company, this signal becomes exhausting when chronic loneliness hits.

You perceive this signal with caution and every opportunity for socialization goes through an extensive threat detection process.

Your brain pays a heavy price for this hypersensitivity as chronic loneliness is linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Moreover, [lonely people are less likely to exercise and more likely to smoke](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6377432/), both of which factors harm the brain in the long run.

We are social creatures so loneliness will harm your brain and cut short your longevity.

Moreover the lifestyle effects on loneliness will push you to a grave sooner than later. So, take time out of your busy schedule and socialize.

Nourish your relationships consistently with constant contact if you're not able to meet in person.

Dr. Lipman believes being kind to each other can bridge the gap and make us feel less lonely.
### Conclusion

Longevity is hidden in your daily routine, it's the simple truth that can improve the quality of your life.

But you waste this opportunity by making lifestyle mistakes that harm your longevity in the long run.

These daily blunders wreck your longevity, so make an active effort to rectify these mistakes.

* Keep a water bottle with you to beat dehydration.* Focus on optimizing your sleep routine daily.* Avoid inflammatory foods, to keep your gut healthy.* Prioritize your relationships to beat loneliness.* Add strength training to your routine.
